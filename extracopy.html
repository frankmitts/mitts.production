  <h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2>
  <p class="">Before I even put pen to paper, I think a few decades ahead. Would people still love my pieces fifty years into the future? What materials would best suit the air and temperature? Will I be making menswear for a colony on Mars? Creating something new yet timeless is my mission. I give nods to more classic shapes and silhouettes, but apply a certain neo-futurist element to everything I touch. Above all, my artform is about ergonomics. This is fashion for the man of tomorrow.</p>
